Thank you for downloading FLAIM!

This file describes the installation procedure for FLAIM-Core. After
installing this package, you will also need to install at least one
I/O module. Module installation instructions are packaged with the
individual modules.

----------

1. Invoke the configure shell script from the directory with the FLAIM
   sources.

   /flaim-core> ./configure

   This will prepare a Makefile for you so that you may build FLAIM.

   If you wish to specify a non-default installation directory, you may
   do so in this step. FLAIM will install into $(prefix)/flaim.
   The value of $(prefix) is /usr/local by default, but you may change
   this behavior by specifying a different value when invoking
   ./configure. For example, to install in /usr/flaim, invoke:

   /flaim-core> ./configure --prefix=/usr

   If you do not specify --prefix, FLAIM will install into
   /usr/local/flaim.

2. Run make.

   /flaim-core> make

3. Become the superuser. This is necessary if you are going to make
   install into the default location.

4. Run make install.

   /flaim-core> make install

   This will install the FLAIM executable, man pages, configuration
   files, and wrapper scripts. It will also create a symbolic link
   connecting /usr/bin/flaim to the script used to invoke FLAIM.

5. Install any modules you wish to use. See the installation
   instructions for individual modules.

6. Run FLAIM. Refer to the man page or invoke the help option to view
   command line syntax.

   /flaim-core> flaim --help

----------

Note that the installation location of FLAIM is determined when you
run make install, _not_ when you run FLAIM. If you move the FLAIM
executable and data directories, you will need to edit the wrapper
script that passes data to FLAIM. It is located in installdir/flaim,
where installdir is the original installation directory.
